1) what is Redux?
Redux is a concept of data storing and communcation in the client-side, it's like DB in the Client-side that help you to do queries like: select , update , delete in to JSON's DB.

2) before we start with redux we should know that:
we have 2 kinds of functions:

  a)pure functions: which return value just depending on the arguments and it never overwright the main value.

  b)Impure functions: which can deal with DB in the back-end and it can overwright the main value .

  redux use pure function that mean in every time it create new state depending on action and prev state for that it also call (single state tree). 

3) Reducer: it is a function that take prev state & action (object should has 'type' key and the value should be string) to return new state .

ex:
const counter(state=0,action){
	switch(action.type){
	case 'INCREMENT':
	     return state+1;
	case 'DECREMENT':
	     return state-1;
	default:
	     return state;
	}
}

let start with start redux:

-install redux:
 npm install --save react-redux

- create DB:
 const { CreateStore} = Redux;

-create DB from reducer(function that will generate states):
 const store=CreateState(reducer-name);

-functions that we can use:
 store.getState();  => give the curent state.
 store.dispatch({type:'INCREMENT'}); => call the reducer
 store.subscribe(render); => it render the view depending on the states 

  we can imagine it like:

                 Action => Reducer => Store => View
